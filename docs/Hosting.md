# **Production Deployment**

_Note:_ We'll be deploying this back-end to Digital Ocean. If you're a student you can get _`$50`_ in credits [here](https://education.github.com/pack/offers) otherwise you can get a _`$5/mo`_ droplet.

## **Prerequisites**:

- Digital Ocean Account [Create one here](https://www.digitalocean.com/)

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Creating a Droplet** üíß

1) Choosing an image
- First head over to droplet creation page
- Under the `Choose an image` section, go ahead and select _`Marketplace`_
- From there locate the `Docker` Image and select it.
- Next scrolldown the _`Choose a Plan`_ section, and select `Standard`, with the _`$5/mo`_ option.

2) Authentication
- Now we'll need to setup Authentication method for our droplet. There's two ways you can do so. The first way it using `SSH Keys`, the second is using `One-time password`.
- We'll be using `SSH Keys` due to them being common, and more secure.
- Click `New SSH Key` and a Modal like such should come up

- You'll notice a little tutorial on the right, follow that and you'll be good to go!
- Last but not least click the `Create Droplet` button.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Connecting to a Droplet** üíª
Now that we've created our droplet it's time to connect to it.

Before connecting to the Droplet make sure you're using a terminal capable of running [SSH Commands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell)

- First things first you're going to want to copy the [_`ipv4`_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4) address associated with your Droplet.
- Once done we can beging connecting to our droplet, to do so, in your terminal, write out this command `ssh root@153.242.182.92` replacing the entered_`ipv4`_ address with yours.

Here's that command broken down.

- `ssh` signifies that we want to run an `ssh` command.
- `root` is saying you want to be logged in as `root`. `root` is a user that comes with linux by default, and has access to all commands and files on a Linux or Unix-like OS.
- `@153.242.182.92` is the server you're connecting to.
- Last but not least! If connected to the server properly you should see something like such
